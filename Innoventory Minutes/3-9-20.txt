1. Requirements due date and set it for today
2. Need ability to login as a certain user; need to add that
3. We want a three-layer application:
	A. Top: Interface (what user sees)
	B. Middle: API (a way to query database)
	C. Bottom: Datebase
4. Deliverables
	A. Proposed 10-day sprints
	B. Acknowledged delivery date to be 53 days from now
5. How should we do the first sprint?
	A. Create a backlog
	B. Create categories for products
	C. We're using Trello to track progress and tasks
6. Lowered priorities of difficult requirements (adding descriptions and images to products)
7. Establish authentication methods to distinguish consumer with employee (maybe a different button). Each different user will see a different screen based on their authentication.

8. Determined desktop gui to be a generic console / command line
