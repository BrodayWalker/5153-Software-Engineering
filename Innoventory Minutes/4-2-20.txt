{- Demonstrate python and kivy login and search capabilities
	- Desktop allows log-in and search result printing
	- Mobile allows log-in and log-out, password change, nuke option
- Expressed desire to add relevant images to items (and make them clickable)
- Discussed shopping cart schema
	- Have its own collection (Shopping Cart)
	- Format:
		{username: [
				{"item":<item_name>,"quantity":<number_of_items>},
			   	{"item":<item_name>,"quantity":<number_of_items>}
			  ]}
	- Item price will be determined at checkout by returning to the item in the database and grabbing the price from there
	- There needs to be a "Clear Cart", "Checkout", "Change Quantity" button
- Next iteration (numba 5) will be over search functionality
- Talked about project rubric

Deliverables:
- Implement a valid searching GUI
	- displays a list of item names
	- items should be clickable
	- an item's page should have availability, price, quantity, and (eventually) picture
- Python GUI needs to transition from login page to search page
- Search bar needs to appear on search results page
- Think about writing tests while writing the code (keep you automated and manual tests around)
